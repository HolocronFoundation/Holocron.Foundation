		<p>Welcome to the <b>Holocron.Foundation</b>. We aim to preserve important scientific and cultural works on the Ethereum Blockchain, all while contributing knowledge regarding storage and other related breakthroughs to the greater Ethereum ecosystem through our open source code.</p>
		
		<p>The <b>Holocron.Foundation</b> initially began as an attempt to retain long term data on the Ethereum Blockchain, but as work progressed I realized the good that could be done using this technology. In essence, this project turns <b>all</b> Ethereum Nodes into an <b>immutable</b> and <b>decentralized</b> library and repository of knowledge. This means that unless the <b>entirety</b> of the Ethereum Network and every copy of the Ethereum Blockchain were destroyed, then every piece of uploaded knowledge will be available in <b>perpetuity</b>, <b>unaltered</b>, and <b>uncensored</b>.</p>
		
		<p>Though the above would be enough of a reason to complete this project, there are also several additional benefits:</p>
		<ul class="bullet">
			<li>This project provides inherent value to the Ethereum Blockchain. Anyone will be able to access the works uploaded for free, and, if running a node, even when internet connections are interrupted. This provides a reason for additional adoption and usage of Ethereum by the general population and provides additional value in running a node. I can envision a future in which every physical library runs at least a single node.</li>
			<li>Data storage on blockchain</li>
			<li>Case of easy integration into a LAMP stack</li>
			<li>This project provides a way to "burn" unwanted Ethereum in a productive method. People might choose to
