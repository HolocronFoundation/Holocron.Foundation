			<h1>The Holocron.Foundation</h1>
			<h2>Preserving yesterday and building tommorrow</h2>
			<p>Welcome to the <b>Holocron.Foundation</b>. We aim to preserve the scientific and cultural works of yesterday whilst building out the infrastructure to power the galaxy tommorrow. In order to accomplish these goals, the <b>Holocron.Foundation</b> has undertaken several projects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Phoenix</li>
				<li>Communal.Network</li>
				<li>Eden Drive</li>
				<li>Apollo Network</li>
				<li>PyO</li>
				<li>QuickTMI</li>
				<li>Fluent</li>
				<li>UOS</li>
				<li>CiteIt</li>
				<li>Journal</li>
				<li>GIN</li>
				<li>UNGovern</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These projects are outlined in more detail in our <a href="papers/Ouroboros.docx">working paper</a>, and collectively compose Phase I of the Holocron.Foundation, entitled Ouroboros.</p>

			<p>According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Ouroboros is an "emblematic serpent of ancient Egypt and Greece represented with its tail in its mouth, continually devouring itself and being reborn from itself. A gnostic and alchemical symbol, Ouroboros expresses the unity of all things, material and spiritual, which never disappear but perpetually change form in an eternal cycle of destruction and re-creation." Phase I of the Holocron.Foundation is named for Ouroboros because it consists of the creation of a galactic network with advanced communication, governance, economic, and scientific capabilities which can consume and improve itself.</p>
			<h3>Prior Work</h3>
			The current projects of the <b>Holocron.Foundation</b> build upon older codebases and examples of ours. These projects have evolved into the present projects, but they still provide valuable examples and information. They include:
			<ul>
				<li>Library: Library has been folded into Eden Drive, but an older build exists on the Ethereum Blockchain, which consists of delivering three texts globally in a censor resistant manner. These texts are:
					<ol>
						<li><a href="Archive/library/text.html?bookID=1">The Declaration of Independence</a></li>
						<li><a href="Archive/library/text.html?bookID=4">The Gettysburg Address</a></li>
						<li><a href="Archive/library/text.html?bookID=11">Alices Aventures in Wonderland</a></li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Reincarnati.online: Reincarnati.online has been folded into Communal.Network. Reincarnati.online consists of delivering the web via Ethereum. Though the project has been refactored and rolled into Communal.Network, you can <a href="Archive/reincarnati.online/home.html">view examples of the html and JavaScript containing the three texts from the library delivered via Ethereum</a>. To accomplish this, JSZip was also uploaded to the Etheruem Blockchain, which may prove useful.</li>
			</ul>
