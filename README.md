# The Holocron.Foundation

_Preserving yesterday and building tommorrow_

Welcome to the Holocron.Foundation. We aim to preserve the scientific and cultural works of yesterday whilst building out the infrastructure to power the galaxy tomorrow. The Holocron.Foundation has undertaken projects to further these goals:

## Prior work

The current projects of the Holocron.Foundation build upon older code-bases and examples of ours. These projects have evolved into the present projects, but they still provide valuable examples and information. They include:

## Support

We intend to do our best to build out this project as quickly as possible, however, this could be greatly accelerated in a few ways:

- **Code:** This is one of the best ways to help support, whether you're a novice, you only know portions of the stack we are using, or you only have a minor contribution, your work will help build this quicker and better!
- **Use:** Using our projects is crucial, particularly items like Communal.Network. A bigger userbase simply leads to a more robust project.
- **Share:** Spreading the word helps to change the world! It also contributes to the other methods of support.
- **Donate:** We have no paid employees at present, which means no one is working on this full-time, which could greatly accelerate progress. All the money that has been expended has come out of our own pockets. Whether it's enough to buy one of us a beer or enough to get an office and some employees, any amount helps.
