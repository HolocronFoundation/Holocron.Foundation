# Holocron.Foundation

Welcome to the Holocron.Foundation. We aim to preserve important scientific and cultural works on the Ethereum Blockchain, all while contributing knowledge regarding storage and other related breakthroughs to the greater Ethereum ecosystem through our open source code. We will initially begin with US Public Domain Books in .txt format, but we aim to expand to other offerings as soon as any bugs or other issues are sorted out. Development will be very rapid, and new items will be added as quickly as possible.

The Holocron.Foundation initially began as an attempt to retain long term data on the Ethereum Blockchain, but as work progressed I realized the good that could be done using this technology. Check out our current projects below!

Please feel free to contribute! We need to build up documentation, fixes, and compatibility lists. I made this to open up and work with the greater community!

# Full Projects

**library**

Current version: 1.0

The library turns **all** Ethereum Nodes into an **immutable** and **decentralized** library and repository of knowledge. This means that unless the entirety of the Ethereum Network and every copy of the Ethereum Blockchain were destroyed, then every piece of uploaded knowledge will be available in **perpetuity**, **unaltered**, and **uncensored**. Some other benefits are listed below:

* This project provides inherent value to the Ethereum Blockchain. Anyone will be able to access the works uploaded for free, and, if running a node, even when internet connections are interrupted. This provides a reason for additional adoption and usage of Ethereum by the general population and provides additional value in running a node. I can envision a future in which **every physical library runs at least a single node**.

* This project contributes storage methods, utilities, and examples to the Ethereum Blockchain.

**reincarnati.online**

Current version: 0.9 public beta

reincarnati.online provides web browsing over the blockchain instead of using traditional servers. The interface is a bit clunky, but it is fully functional.

To create your own page that runs on reincarnati.online, convert your html, css, and javascript into a single javascript file. Test it out an make sure it runs as expected! Then, take this file, compress it via zip (optionally, in order to save on storage costs), and upload it using our utilities! You can then load jszip.min.js from the chain, and then run your file too!

**phoenix**

Current version: 0.0

phoenix is the open source and public domain generalized implementation of the technology behind the library. phoenix aims to bring the databases of yesterday into the web of tommorow by providing utilities dedicated to porting CSVs and SQL databases to the Ethereum Blockchain. Storing important data on the blockchain provides key benefits including:

* Redundancy and permanence: Your data will never dissapear.
* Accesibility: Access your data on any Ethereum Node, or use public endpoints to pull your data over the internet.
* Verfication and auditability: Using the blockchain allows users to verify that your data is accurate and complete at any time.
* Smart extensions: Leverage the power of the Ethereum Network to add smart functions to your data, or create a public interface to allow easy access.

Phoenix is young and just beggining - curruntly it is a sparse project on Github. However, by generalizing the technology behind another Holocron.Foundation Project, the library, we'll be laying the foundation for what I envision being an easy to use utility. My end goal is to have desktop applications that anyone with or without any computing experience will be able to use. Though we're not there yet, we're off to a good start!

# Github Branches

* main: main contains any changes that have been published on the blockchain or online

* documentation-cleanup: this branch is focused on making the project more understandable and removing useless code, optimizing existing code, or writing documentation

* library-dev: this branch is focused on changes to the library project

If you would like to contribute, please push to whichever branch would be best suited, or create a new branch (e.g. phoenix-dev).
