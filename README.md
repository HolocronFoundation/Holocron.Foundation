# Holocron.Foundation

Welcome to the Holocron.Foundation. We aim to preserve important scientific and cultural works on the Ethereum Blockchain, all while contributing knowledge regarding storage and other related breakthroughs to the greater Ethereum ecosystem through our open source code. We will initially begin with US Public Domain Books in .txt format, but we aim to expand to other offerings as soon as any bugs or other issues are sorted out. Development will be very rapid, and new items will be added as quickly as possible.

The Holocron.Foundation initially began as an attempt to retain long term data on the Ethereum Blockchain, but as work progressed I realized the good that could be done using this technology. Check out our current projects below!

Please feel free to contribute! We need to build up documentation, fixes, and compatibility lists. I made this to open up and work with the greater community!

# Full Projects

**library**

Current version: 1.0

The library turns **all** Ethereum Nodes into an **immutable** and **decentralized** library and repository of knowledge. This means that unless the entirety of the Ethereum Network and every copy of the Ethereum Blockchain were destroyed, then every piece of uploaded knowledge will be available in **perpetuity**, **unaltered**, and **uncensored**.

**reincarnati.online**

Current version: 0.9 public beta

reincarnati.online provides web browsing over the blockchain instead of using traditional servers. The interface is a bit clunky, but it is fully functional.

To create your own page that runs on reincarnati.online, convert your html, css, and javascript into a single javascript file.

**phoenix**

Current version: 0.0

# Github Branches

* main: main contains any changes that have been published on the blockchain or online

* documentation-cleanup: this branch is focused on making the project more understandable and removing useless code, optimizing existing code, or writing documentation

* library-dev: this branch is focused on changes to the library project

If you would like to contribute, please push to whichever branch would be best suited, or create a new branch (e.g. phoenix-dev).
